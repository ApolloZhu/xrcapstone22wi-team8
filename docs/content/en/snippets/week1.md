<!-- For this first week snippet you should focus on any testing of project ideas as well as any work done for your proof of concept. -->

## New Features/Functionalities

- Team website is setup using static site generator Hugo with the Ananke theme and deployed using GitHub Actions
- We explored similar projects from previous quarters and on the marketplace to study their UI/UX decisions

## Review Requests

There's nothing needing review this week.

## Blocking Issues

There are no blocking issues this week and we don't need other assistance.

## What's Next

Next week, we'll write up the project requirements document and pitch our ideas, decide our project name and start working on the implementation.
